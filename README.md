# KotlinMPP
This is my first experience in working with a Kotlin Multiplatform. 
There are standard expect/actual functions, like getPlatformName(), also some work with coroutines (testing experimental ticker()) and working with api requests (ktor, kotlinx-serialization).
This has been done only for android part, ios isn't prepared, because of I don't have mac :))
